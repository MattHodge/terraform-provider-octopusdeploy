# [DEPRECIATED] terraform-provider-octopusdeploy

Good news!

The team at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) have taken notice of this project :tada:.

We have both decided the best way forward for the project is for the team at Octopus Deploy to take over the reins and continue the development and support.

This means that Octopus Deploy will be getting an *official* Terraform provider :heart_eyes:.

It was never my intention to spend a lot of time looking after this project, so I am very excited that the team reached out and offered assistance.

The project has been forked at https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/terraform-provider-octopusdeploy.

Please head over there to contribute and file bug reports!

Happy Deploying!
